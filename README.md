# Unnamed Compiled Language

A relatively high-level ergonomic compiled language inspired by Rust.

## Expected Features

- AOT compiled using [cranelift](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift).
- Hindley-Milner type system with typeclasses.
- Reference counting.
- Support for pattern matching.

I don't expect it to be the fastest language, but I do want to implement a few optimisations (e.g. inlining) before handing over control to cranelift.

## Progress

See: [todo list](TODO.md).
